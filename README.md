# Conway's Game of Life: A Python Implementation

This repository contains a Python implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton invented by British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. The Game of Life is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. The aim of this repository is to provide a practical understanding of cellular automata and how they can be implemented and visualized using programming.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* You have installed Python 3.x
* You have installed the following Python libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib

## Installing Conway's Game of Life

To install Conway's Game of Life, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the directory containing the script

## Using Conway's Game of Life

To run the script, use the following command from the terminal:

```
python game_of_life.py
```

This will display an animation representing the evolution of the cellular automaton based on the rules of Conway's Game of Life.
